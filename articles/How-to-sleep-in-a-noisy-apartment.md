## How Noise-Canceling Window Inserts Work
Noise-Canceling Window Inserts work by using a combination of materials and technologies to absorb and block sound waves. The inserts are typically made of a thick, heavy material that is designed to absorb sound energy, rather than transmitting it. The material is usually a type of acoustic foam or fiberglass, which is effective at absorbing sound waves in the frequency range of human hearing. The inserts are also designed to be airtight, which helps to prevent sound waves from entering the room through gaps and cracks. By installing Noise-Canceling Window Inserts, you can significantly reduce the amount of noise that enters your bedroom, making it easier to sleep through the night.
